## Project Description
To diagnose plant leaf diseases, this research gives a thorough assessment of four different supervised learning models. YOLOv8, SSD-Mobilenet, CNN, and Faster RCNN are among the models being examined; each is well known for its prowess in object identification and classification tasks. This work closely examines their performance in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency through painstaking experimentation and rigorous evaluation. The goal is to offer insightful information on how effective these models are for actual deployment in agricultural settings.
